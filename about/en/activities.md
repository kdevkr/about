# Activities & Open Source Contributions

::: tip Activity Direction
I focus on actively reporting errors and improvements found in practical work, and improving documentation quality to enhance other developers' experiences. I carefully attend to even small details like minor translation errors or code highlighting, believing that these details can significantly improve the developer experience. Additionally, I share my experiences through blogs and communities to help other developers.
