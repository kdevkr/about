# Open Source Contribution Activities

::: tip Contribution Direction
I focus on actively reporting errors and improvements found in practical work, and improving documentation quality to enhance other developers' experiences. I carefully attend to even small details like minor translation errors or code highlighting, believing that these details can significantly improve the developer experience.
