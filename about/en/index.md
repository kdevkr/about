# A Developer as Cozy as Snorlax and Cute as an Otter

![](/fighting.png)

With <span :title="`${diffYears} years ${diffMonths+1} months`">{{ diffYears + 1 }} years</span> of experience, I work as a backend developer, responsible for developing and maintaining Java and Spring Boot-based application servers. I enjoy **analyzing and solving problems by finding their root causes**, which has led me to focus on resolving various system-wide issues. To create better systems, I **learn diverse skills from a full-stack perspective**, including frontend and infrastructure knowledge beyond backend, to appropriately address system requirements and issues. Rather than simply following technology trends, I'm more interested in appropriate engineering and **work with colleagues to find suitable solutions** while avoiding over-engineering.

### Who is Mambo?

The nickname Mambo is inspired by **[Snorlax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GZ32821pf8)**, evoking a **warm and cozy image**. Some say I actually share many similarities with an Otter, making me **unexpectedly cute**. While I [love sleeping like Snorlax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3UjbNIuqQY), when it comes to work, I focus on finding better solutions based on detailed root cause analysis and strive to avoid over-engineering. Since I don't consider myself particularly good at documentation and organization, I **pay extra attention to tracking work history and managing issues**.

- Aim to become a full-stack engineer capable of solving system-wide problems
- Resolve system requirements and issues from an appropriate engineering perspective
- Value work history tracking and colleague opinions in solving system problems

### Here's how my colleagues see me

A unique Snorlax with precise thinking and quick hands ðŸ™‚

They have such a warm heart. It's impressive to see them exploring and striving to become a better developer.

I'm cheering for Mambo as they grow into a leader. ðŸ’ª

Someone with mature charm that shows from their name ðŸ˜Š

They quietly approached first, and their comfortable and gentle demeanor helped me adjust to the company.

Mambo consistently explores areas where they need improvement, never procrastinates, and always approaches work with rational choices and decisions aimed at the best outcomes. ðŸ˜„

::: info :woman_technologist: Wendy
While quietly focusing on their own work diligently, Mambo never loses their kindness towards others.

When asked about something unknown, they explain it in an easy-to-understand way and have the sensitivity to make their colleagues comfortable. They're an indispensable presence for their coworkers.

Working with Mambo always leads to a pleasant completion of tasks ðŸ¤—
