While software engineering perspective states that <strong>analysis and design are based on clear requirements</strong>, in reality, even domain experts with extensive experience often have unclear information. The more unclear the domain and requirements are, the higher the possibility that the system will have inherent unsafe defects.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Understanding Business Domain</p><p>Knowledge of development alone is not enough; understanding of the business domain is essential.
